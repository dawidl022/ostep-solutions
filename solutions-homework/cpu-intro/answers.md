CPU utilization should be 100%. Neither process makes any I/O requests, so
neither process will block. Instead each process will run on the CPU till
completion.

6 CPU ticks + the I/O wait time. 4 CPU for the first process, 1 I/O initiation
time waiting for the I/O to complete and 1 I/O completion for the second
process. The processes run sequentially, so the second process only initiates
the I/O operation once the first process completes.

Now the time to complete both processes is 6 CPU ticks + min(the I/O wait time -
4, 0).

Switching the order matters, because the `PROCESS_SWITCH_BEHAVIOR` is by default
set to `SWITCH_ON_IO`, meaning that when the first processes blocks waiting for
I/O, the second process has the chance to run CPU instructions to completion.

In the previous example, there were no more processes to run after the process
that blocked for I/O, so the CPU was just idle.

Now we get the exact same results in terms of total time to run both processes
as when we ran the CPU-bound process before the I/O-build process. Essentially,
we have eliminated the opportunity to use concurrency when one process blocks
for I/O.

> 5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch

Since `SWITCH_ON_IO` is the default option for the switching strategy, we get
the same results as expressed in the answer to question 3.

> 6. One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I

> -p`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

Upon completion of I/O, the process that was waiting is put at the end of the
queue of processes to run. This means that the first process only gets to issue
its first I/O request before the other 3 processes get to run to completion.

This is not the optimal usage of system resources while the CPU-bound processes
are running, I/O is idle for the most part, and while the I/O bound process
is running the CPU is idle for the most part.

> 7. Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which

Now the I/O requests are nicely interleaved with the execution of CPU-bound
processes.

A process that issued an I/O request is likely to issue another I/O request,
hence it would be efficient to let the process make the I/O request as soon as
it can, so that while it's blocked, other processes can run, and conversely,
while other processes are using the CPU, an I/O operation can be talking place.

```txt
python3 process-run.py -s 1 -l 3:50,3:50

Produce a trace of what would happen when you run these processes:
Process 0
  cpu
  io
  io_done
  io
  io_done

Process 1
  cpu
  cpu
  cpu
```

My prediction with `IO_RUN_LATER` and `SWITCH_ON_IO`:

```

 11        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
 12        BLOCKED          DONE                           1

 15*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1              
```

Changing to `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` will have no effect in this example, since there
are no more processes that could be running concurrently on the I/O-bounded
processes's second I/O request.

My prediction with `IO_RUN_LATER` and `SWITCH_ON_END`:
```

 14        BLOCKED         READY                           1
 15*   RUN:io_done         READY             1              
 16          DONE        RUN:cpu             1              
 17          DONE        RUN:cpu             1              
 18          DONE        RUN:cpu             1              
```

In general `IO_RUN_LATER` has no effect if `SWITCH_ON_END` is set, and behaves
the same as `SWITCH_ON_END` with `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE`.
